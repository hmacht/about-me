  <p class="title">Hi, I'm Henry Macht</p>
  <p>I graduated from Virginia Tech in 2023 with a bachelor‚Äôs degree in Computer Science. I started programming in 2012 and never looked back. P.S. I have decided to make this site as simple as possible to focus more time on my projects.</p>

  <b>Macht Development</b>
  <p>Our mission is to build platforms with sustainable online behavior. We built FAADE in 2020 to create a healthier space for social media, and we built True Capture in 2024 to help internet users decipher what content is real online. I have built a team of three top-of-their-class engineers (including myself), as well as a few business-savvy friends and, of course, my girlfriend who runs all our marketing. Oh, and I have created some popular word games. Here is a complete list of our work:</p>
